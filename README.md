Archrome is a Chrome extension inspired by the Arc browser, designed to help you organize your browsing with spaces, pinned tabs, and a clean, sidebar-based interface.

**Note:** Archrome uses your browser's bookmarks as the single source of truth for your spaces and bookmarks. This means you can seamlessly import your existing organization and manage your data from one place, maximizing the use of your existing data.

## Features

### Spaces

*   **Organize with Spaces:** Create distinct "spaces" to separate your work, personal projects, or any other context.
*   **Bookmark-Powered:** Each space is powered by a bookmark folder, making it easy to manage and sync across your devices.
*   **Custom Icons:** Use an emoji as the first character in your bookmark folder's name to set a custom icon for your space.
*   **Seamless Switching:** When you switch between spaces, your current tabs are saved and closed, and the tabs for the new space are automatically opened.

### Tab Management

*   **Active Tabs List:** See all your open tabs for the current space in a dedicated list.
*   **Quickly Close Tabs:** Close tabs directly from the sidebar.
*   **Move Tabs Between Spaces:** Right-click a tab to easily move it to another space.

### Bookmarks

*   **Space-Specific Bookmarks:** View all the bookmarks for the current space right in the sidebar.
*   **Drag-and-Drop to Save:** Drag a tab from the "Tabs" list to the "Bookmarks" list to instantly create a bookmark and close the tab.

### Pinned Items

Keep your most important links always accessible in the "Pinned" section, which is always visible at the top of the sidebar, regardless of the space you are in.

**How to use Pinned Items:**

1.  In your browser's bookmarks, create a folder named `pin`.
2.  Add any bookmarks you want to have quick access to into this `pin` folder.
3.  These bookmarks will automatically appear in the "Pinned" section of the sidebar.

### Keyboard Shortcut

*   **Toggle Sidebar:** Quickly open or close the sidebar with the `Alt+Q` keyboard shortcut.
