# Archrome

Archrome is a Chrome extension inspired by the Arc browser, designed to help you organize your browsing with spaces, pinned tabs, and a clean, sidebar-based interface.

## Features

### Spaces

*   **Organize with Spaces:** Create distinct "spaces" to separate your work, personal projects, or any other context.
*   **Bookmark-Powered:** Each space is powered by a bookmark folder, making it easy to manage and sync across your devices.
*   **Custom Icons:** Use an emoji as the first character in your bookmark folder's name to set a custom icon for your space.
*   **Seamless Switching:** When you switch between spaces, your current tabs are saved and closed, and the tabs for the new space are automatically opened.

### Tab Management

*   **Active Tabs List:** See all your open tabs for the current space in a dedicated list.
*   **Quickly Close Tabs:** Close tabs directly from the sidebar.
*   **Move Tabs Between Spaces:** Right-click a tab to easily move it to another space.

### Bookmarks

*   **Space-Specific Bookmarks:** View all the bookmarks for the current space right in the sidebar.
*   **Drag-and-Drop to Save:** Drag a tab from the "Tabs" list to the "Bookmarks" list to instantly create a bookmark and close the tab.

### Pinned Items

*   **Easy Access:** Keep your most important links always accessible in the "Pinned" section.
*   **Simple to Use:** Just create a bookmark folder named "pin" and add your favorite sites.

### Keyboard Shortcut

*   **Toggle Sidebar:** Quickly open or close the sidebar with the `Alt+Q` keyboard shortcut.
